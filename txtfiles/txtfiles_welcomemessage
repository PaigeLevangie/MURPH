<p>MURPH is an interactive Shiny app created by master's student Paige Levangie as her thesis project. MURPH is an acronym for Multi-Use R Programming Helper, created in order to make an interactive tool that makes data visualization and analysis accessible for everyone. Not everyone knows how to use R and enjoys that part of the research process. Hopefully this tool will help those who decide to use it, and maybe relax their intense hatred for all things R related. All you need to do is follow along with what MURPH tells you. Enjoy!<p><h4>Multi - Use R Programming Helper<h4>
