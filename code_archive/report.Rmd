**Disclaimer:**  

This report displays outputs created using the tool MURPH. All user "saved" outputs, and automatically generated outputs. You also receive an additional R script that contains all of the R code you need in order to "run" and generate these outputs yourself. You can use and share the tool MURPH, all the provided code, and outputs in this report, however you like! hopefully using this tool will help you on your journey in learning how to navigate and use R in the future!

Happy coding :)
